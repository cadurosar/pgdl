    Average of the inverse of radius of average adversarial robustness.
    i.e the radius of the ball where enough randomly sampled examples are adversarial.
    The population of perturbed examples (4 in total) follows the gradient w.r.t input to seek for the adversarial direction (PGD algorithm).
    The radius keepen is the one for which most of the examples are adversarial (at least one over the 4).  
    An additional loss ensures that those adversarial examples stay far apart from each other (cosine similiarty minimization).
    Median of Means ensures the stability of the estimate.
    More details will be given in a workshop style paper, if organizers ask us to do it.
