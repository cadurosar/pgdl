    Average of the norm of the output w.r.t input.
    This heuristik is a proxy of robustness, since the gradient of the input
    is used to build adversarial samples in most methods.
    Moreover it is a local approximation of Lipschitz constant. The higher the constant,
    the less regularized the network is, and the worst we expect the results to be.
